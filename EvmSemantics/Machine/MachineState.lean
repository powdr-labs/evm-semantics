`MachineState` `μ` — the (shallow) machine-level state used by every EVM
operation. Holds the gas counter, the byte-addressed `memory`, and the
`returnData` from the previous nested call. Active-word count `i` tracks
the highest word index that's been touched (for memory expansion cost).

We expose memory helpers used by the small-step rules: `mload`, `mstore`,
`mstore8`, `mcopy`, `readBytes` and `writeBytes`. ByteArray reads past
the current size are zero-padded, which matches Yellow Paper semantics.

def activeWordsAfter (curr offset sz : Nat) : Nat :=
  if sz = 0 then curr else
    let lastByte := offset + sz - 1
    let lastWord := lastByte / 32 + 1
    Nat.max curr lastWord

/-- Yellow Paper memory cost `C_mem(a) = G_memory·a + ⌊a²/512⌋` (eq. 326).
    `a` is the number of 32-byte words currently active.  `G_memory = 3`. -/
def memCost (a : Nat) : Nat := 3 * a + a ^ 2 / 512

/-- Gas to charge for the memory expansion that *would result* from touching
    the byte range `[offset, offset+sz)` given that `curr` words are already
    active.  Returns `0` when the access fits inside the already-active
    region.  The reference high-water-mark calculation is `activeWordsAfter`,
    which matches the Yellow Paper's `⌈(offset+sz)/32⌉` rounding.

    This is what protects the runtime from OOM on huge offsets/sizes: the
    quadratic term in `memCost` makes any `offset+sz` past a few MiB cost
    astronomically more gas than any real transaction can hold, so legitimate
    callers will hit `OutOfGas` long before the underlying `ByteArray` is
    asked to allocate something dangerous. -/

/-- Two-range version of `memExpansionDelta`, used by MCOPY which touches
    both the source-read range `[off1, off1+sz1)` and the destination-write
    range `[off2, off2+sz2)`. The expansion is charged for the union. -/

/-- Read `n` bytes from `bs` starting at `start`, zero-padding past the end.

    `start` is clamped to `bs.size` before being passed to `ByteArray.extract`.
    This is semantically transparent — bytes at or past the end read as zero
    either way — but it avoids handing a `~2^256` index to the runtime's
    `extract`, which would otherwise OOM/abort even when only a small `n` bytes
    are requested (e.g. CALLDATALOAD/CALLDATACOPY/LOG with a huge offset, which
    the EVM treats as a cheap zero-padded read). The total allocation is exactly
    `n` bytes (`take` real + `pad` zeros), independent of `start`. -/

/-- Read a 32-byte big-endian word from `bs` at `offset`, zero-padding
    past the end. Used by both `MLOAD` (over memory) and `CALLDATALOAD`
